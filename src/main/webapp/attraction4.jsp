	    <p>
	    	Mount Bromo, located in East Java, is one of Indonesia's most iconic volcanoes. 
	    	It stands in the middle of the Tengger caldera and is part of Bromo Tengger Semeru National Park. 
	    	The area is famous for its dramatic sunrises, where the smoky peak of Bromo is silhouetted against the glowing sky. 
	    	Tourists can hike or ride jeeps across the sea of volcanic sand to reach the crater's edge. 
	    	Bromo's otherworldly landscape makes it a must-visit for nature lovers and photographers.
