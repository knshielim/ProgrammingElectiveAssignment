	    	Lake Toba, situated in North Sumatra, is the largest volcanic lake in the world. 
	    	Formed by a massive supervolcanic eruption around 75,000 years ago, the lake spans over 1,100 square kilometers and reaches depths of up to 500 meters. 
	    	At its center lies Samosir Island, a cultural heartland of the Batak people. 
	    	Tourists can enjoy scenic boat rides, explore traditional Batak villages, soak in hot springs, and admire the tranquil natural surroundings.
