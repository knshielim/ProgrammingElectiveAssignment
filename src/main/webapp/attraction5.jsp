	    Lake Toba, situated in North Sumatra, is the largest volcanic lake in the world. Formed by a massive supervolcanic eruption around 75,000 years ago, the lake spans over 1,100 square kilometers and reaches depths of up to 500 meters. At its center lies Samosir Island, a cultural heartland of the Batak people. Tourists can enjoy scenic boat rides, explore traditional Batak villages, soak in hot springs, and admire the tranquil natural surroundings.
