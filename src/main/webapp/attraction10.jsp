				Prambanan is a magnificent Hindu temple complex located near Yogyakarta in Central Java. 
				Built in the 9th century, the complex is dedicated to the Trimurti: Brahma the creator, Vishnu the preserver, and Shiva the destroyer. 
				The main temple stands at 47 meters tall and is surrounded by smaller temples adorned with detailed bas-reliefs. 
				Prambanan is a UNESCO World Heritage Site and is also a venue for traditional dance performances held under the moonlight, adding to its mystical charm.
